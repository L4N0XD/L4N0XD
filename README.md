- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @L4N0XD (Taylan Noronha)

I'm an enthusiastic developer, just starting to finally work in an area that I like and have an affinity for. 
When I was younger, I threw myself into the world of technology and found myself little by little. 
Only when I was 23 I had the courage to play professionally and I saw it as more than just a hobby.

I have knowledge in:
Java, Python, CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, ReactJS.

And I am very interested in Internship.
